/* 
* JavaScript Datatypes :
- JavaScript has 8 Datatypes :

- A JavaScript variable can hold 8 types of data:

* Type	            Description
- String	        A text of characters enclosed in quotes
- Number	        A number representing a mathematical value
- Bigint	        A number representing a large integer
- Boolean	        A data type representing true or false
- Object	        A collection of key-value pairs of data
- Undefined	        A primitive variable with no assigned value
- Null	            A primitive value representing object absence
- Symbol	        A unique and primitive identifier

- Examples :

// String
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Number
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// BigInt
let x = 1234567890123456789012345n;
let y = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345)

// Boolean
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");

// Undefined
let x;
let y;

// Null
let x = null;
let y = null;

// Symbol
const x = Symbol();
const y = Symbol();

* The typeof Operator :
- You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
- The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

- Example :
typeof ""             // Returns "string"
typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"
Example
typeof 0              // Returns "number"
typeof 314            // Returns "number"
typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number"

* JavaScript Strings :
- A string (a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
- Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

- Example :
// Using double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

// Using single quotes:
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

- Example :
// Single quote inside double quotes:
let answer1 = "It's alright";

// Single quotes inside double quotes:
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

// Double quotes inside single quotes:
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
Note
You will learn a lot more about JavaScript Strings later in this tutorial.

* JavaScript Numbers :
- All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
- Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
- Example
// With decimals:
let x1 = 34.00;
// Without decimals:
let x2 = 34;

* Exponential Notation :
- Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:
- Example :
let y = 123e5;    // 12300000
let z = 123e-5;   // 0.00123

* JavaScript Booleans :
- JavaScript booleans can only have one of two values: true or false
- The boolean value of an expression is the basis for JavaScript comparisons:

Description	                 Expression	        Returns
Not equal to	             (x == 8)	        false
Unequal to	                 (x != 8)	        true
Greater than	             (x > 8)	        false
Less than	                 (x < 8)	        true

* Datatype undefined :
- In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
- A variable without a value has the datatype undefined.
- A variable without a value also has the value undefined.
- Example :
let carName;

* Empty Values :
- An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
- An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
- Example
let car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"
