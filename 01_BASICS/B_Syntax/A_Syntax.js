// Syntax Rules : Are rules how programs must be constructed.

let x = 5;

JavaScript Values : 
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
- Literals (Fixed values)
- Variables (Variable values)

* JavaScript Literals (Fixed values) :
- The most important syntax rules for literals (fixed values) are:
- Numbers are written with or without decimals: 10.50, 1001.
- Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: "Shetty", 'Shetty'

* JavaScript Keywords :
- Are used to define actions which needs to be performed.
- The let and const keywords create variables.
let a = 10;
const fname = "Shetty";

NOTE : JS keywords are case-sensitive.
JS does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

* Variables (Variable values) :
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- Variables must be identified with unique names.

Define x as a varible : let x;
Assign the value 6 to x : x = 6;

* JavaScript Identifiers :
- An identifier is the name you give to a variable.
Rules for identifiers:
- Must start with a letter, _, or $
- Can contain digits after the first character
- Cannot be a reserved keyword (let, const, if, etc.)
- Are case-sensitive

* JavaScript Operators :
- JavaScript assignment operators (=) assign values to variables:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let sum = x + y;

- JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values: 5 * 10

* JavaScript Expression :
- An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
- (5 + 6) * 10 evaluates to 110: (5 + 6) * 10

- Expressions can also contain variable: x * 10
- "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe": "John" + " " + "Doe"

* JavaScript is Case Sensitive :
- JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
The variables lastName and lastname, are different variables:
Example
let lastName = "Doe";
let lastname = "Peterson";


* JavaScript and Camel Case
Hyphens: first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.
Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
- Underscore: first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
- Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
- Lower Camel Case: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
JavaScript programmers tend to use lower camel case.
