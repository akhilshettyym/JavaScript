# JAVASCRIPT
The programming language of the Web. It can calculate, manipulate and validate data. It can update and change both HTML and CSS.
Makes our website interactive.
- Giving instructions to a computer.
- The computer follows our instructions.

### Syntax
- Rules that we have to follow when using a programming language.
- Similar to English(grammar).
- In programming, we have to follow the rules of syntax exactly.

#### The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
<ol>
<li>Literals (Fixed values)
<li>Variables (Variable values)

#### Keywords
- JavaScript keywords are used to defines actions to be performed.  let x = 5;
- The let and const keywords create variables:                      const fname = "John";

#### Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- Variables must be identified with unique names.

#### Identifiers
An identifier is the name you give to a variable.

##### Rules for identifiers:
<ol>
<li>Must start with a letter, _, or $
<li>Can contain digits after the first character
<li>Cannot be a reserved keyword (let, const, if, etc.)
<li>Are case-sensitive

- JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values

#### Expressions
- An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
(5 + 6) * 10 evaluates to 110

##### NOTE : If we try to cop-paste code in the console, we might get a warning saying pasting is disabled. To fix this we write **allow pasting** in the console and press Enter.

### JS Statements
- A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
- These programming instructions are called statements.
- Most JavaScript programs contain many statements.
- The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

#### JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo"
*document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";*

---
### COMMENTS
#### Single Line Comments
- Single line comments start with //.
- Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

#### Multi-line Comments
- Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
- Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
