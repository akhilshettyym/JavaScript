Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookies

1. Local Storage:
   - Local Storage is a web storage mechanism that allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.
   - Data stored in Local Storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
   - It is accessible only within the domain that created it.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Storing data
   localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');

   // Retrieving data
   const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
   console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe

   // Removing data
   localStorage.removeItem('username');

   // Clearing all data
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. Session Storage:
   - Session Storage is similar to Local Storage but with a key difference: data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the browser tab is closed).
   - It is also accessible only within the domain that created it.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Storing data
   sessionStorage.setItem('sessionID',          '123456');  
    // Retrieving data  
    const sessionID = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionID');
    console.log(sessionID); // Output: 123456

    // Removing data
    sessionStorage.removeItem('sessionID');
    
    // Clearing all data
    sessionStorage.clear();
    ```
    
3. Cookies:
    - Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side and sent to the server with every HTTP request.
    - Cookies have an expiration date and can be set to expire after a certain period.
    - They can be accessed by both the client and server.
    
    Example:
    ```javascript
    // Setting a cookie
    document.cookie = "user=JaneDoe; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";
    
    // Retrieving a cookie
    const cookies = document.cookie;
    console.log(cookies); // Output: user=JaneDoe

    // Deleting a cookie
    document.cookie = "user=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/";
    ```
    
In summary, Local Storage and Session Storage are both client-side storage options with different lifespans, while Cookies are used for both client-side and server-side data storage with more control over expiration and scope.
